                <h1 id="info"><u>Life of Mother Teresa</u></h1>
                <p>Mother Teresa is a humanitarian who is well-known throughout the world for her selfless approach toward those who are in need. 
                She was born on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, Macedonia. She became a nun at the age of 18 and moved to India.
                She began teaching geography at St. Mary’s Convent School in Calcutta. She could not bear to see the sorrows, pains, and difficulties of those around her,
                so she dedicated the remainder of her life to serving the poor and oppressed. 
                
                <br><br>
                In Calcutta, she founded the Missionaries of Charity and Nirmal Hriday, a shelter for the poor.
                Many other branches were opened in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
                She also opened schools and hospitals. She loved children the most and loved to teach the students. 
                There are a lot of schools that provide free education to the poorest of the poor.
                She also started an open-air school to teach the students without taking any money.

                <br><br>

                She chose to live a modest life which drew people from all over the world to volunteer and serve the destitute.  
                She was dearly called ‘Mother’.  
                She was honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize and the Bharat Ratna for her outstanding service. 
                Even years after she died, she still is a great role model to all who know her.

                <br><br>

                After eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and then to India, where she lived most of her life.
                Saint Teresa of Calcutta was canonised on 4 September 2016. The anniversary of her death is her feast day.
                After Mother Teresa founded her religious congregation, it grew to have over 4,500 nuns and was active in 133 countries as of 2012.
                The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis. 
                The congregation also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages and schools. 
                Members take vows of chastity, poverty, 
                and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor."

                <br><br>

                Mother Teresa received several honours, including the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. 
                A controversial figure during her life and after her death, Mother Teresa was admired by many for her charitable work. 
                She was praised and criticised on various counts, such as for her views on abortion and contraception, and was criticized for poor conditions in her houses for the dying. 
                Her authorized biography was written by Navin Chawla and published in 1992, and she has been the subject of other books as well as films. 
                On 6 September 2017, Mother Teresa and Saint Francis Xavier were named co-patrons of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta.
                
                <br><br>

                Mother Teresa's death was mourned in the secular and religious communities. 
                Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif called her "a rare and unique individual who lived long for higher purposes. 
                Her life-long devotion to the care of the poor, the sick, and the disadvantaged was one of the highest examples of service to our humanity." 
                According to former U.N. Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, "She is the United Nations. She is peace in the world."

                <br><br>

                One of Mother Teresa's most outspoken critics was English journalist and antitheist Christopher Hitchens, host of the documentary Hell's Angel (1994) and author of the essay The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice (1995) who wrote in a 2003 article: "This returns us to the medieval corruption of the church, which sold indulgences to the rich while preaching hellfire and continence to the poor. 
                [Mother Teresa] was not a friend of the poor. She was a friend of poverty. She said that suffering was a gift from God. 
                She spent her life opposing the only known cure for poverty, which is the empowerment of women and the emancipation of them from a livestock version of compulsory reproduction."
                He accused her of hypocrisy for choosing advanced treatment for her heart condition.
                Hitchens said that "her intention was not to help people", and that she lied to donors about how their contributions were used. 
                "It was by talking to her that I discovered, and she assured me, that she wasn't working to alleviate poverty",
                he said, "She was working to expand the number of Catholics. She said, 'I'm not a social worker. I don't do it for this reason. 
                I do it for Christ. I do it for the church'".
